# React-Portfolio-App: Part 1

In this project, you will use your knowledge of React and React Router to create a mock portfolio website.

## Getting Started  

* To get started you will need to use `create-react-app` to quickly scaffold a project. You should migrate your components into a `components` folder in the `src` directory and the styles into a `styles` folder in the `src` directory. Link up all pages to make sure they working and test using `npm run start` in the console, use Ctrl+c to exit.

* You will need use `npm install --save react-router-dom` in the terminal to save React Router 4 to your project dependencies and make it available for import.

* In your `index.js` file, you will need to import `{ BrowserRouter, Route, Switch }` from `react-router-dom`.

* You should use your knowledge of nested child components from React to create a `BaseLayout` component that houses a navigation bar and takes children (*Hint: {this.props.children} or {props.children}*) components and renders on each screen. You should be able to see your navigation bar from every component/page rendered.

* You should have the following separate components:

  * `App.js`

  * `BaseLayout.js`

  * `Home.js`

  * `About.js`

  * `Portfolio.js`

* You should have at least two or three buttons that are stylized `<Link>` components in the body of your app.

* Your navigation bar should be fully functional and allow the users to navigate seamlessly through your app. The back button in the browser should take user's to the previous screen (because of the history API and using `<BrowserRouter>`).

* The final project should be a relatively attractive mock portfolio website. The content and styling are up to you. *See example down below* for a general idea of simple project structure, though your project should be more professional and polished!

## Hints  

Remember that you can create a component that receives other components using `{props.children}` or `{this.props.children}` depending upon it being a class based component or a functional component.

Results  

You can style your site to your liking. You aren't being assessed on your design skills, but try to make your site as attractive as possible.

# Part 2 Portfolio refactor 

* You will need to migrate your `<BaseLayout>` component into your `index.js` file and apply it in the appropriate position so that it will render on each page.

* You will no longer need to import your `BaseLayout` component to any other component once you have achieved the proper migration into the `ReactDOM.render` method.

* Replace the `<Link>` components in your `BaseLayout` component with `<NavLink>` components and apply your own styling to differentiate them when they are active (see **HINTS**).

* Use `exact path` to render your splash index page (your `App.js` component).

* Create two more components - a `Contact.js` component and a `References.js` component.

  * `Contacts` should render a page with mock contact information.

  * `Contacts` should have links to an email, Facebook, GitHub, Phone, etc. (these can be mock or your own).

  * `References` should render a list of 3-5 references from past mock employers.

  * Each "reference" should include a name, contact info, and lorem ipsum (or mock recommendations if you are inclined) as their recommendations.

* Add a two more `<NavLink>`'s to your navigation bar in your `<BaseLayout>` and create content for them.

  * Add a link to Contact.

  * Add a link to References.

* The final project should still be an attractive mock portfolio website. The content and styling are up to you. *See example down below* for a general idea of simple project structure, though your project should be more professional and polished! Don't forget about CSS frameworks like Bootstrap to help you out!

# Hints  

* Remember that you can create a component that receives other components using `{props.children}` or `{this.props.children}` depending upon it being a class based component or a functional component.

* Don't forget `activeClassName`!

# Results  

Once complete, your project should have the following functionality but should be more professionally styled
